# customstatus

For da nerds CLONE THIS ON THE RIGHT HAND CORNER IF U DONT KNOW HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE ARCHIVE

https://discord.com/developers/application  (u need to make an app and add assets and get its application and client it... just telling coz yk)

I didnt make any of these RPC or autobots... i just compiled them with a easier guide so people can get their own custom status with ease...
All credits goes to the respective owners of the code..

Here is a full compherehensive guide.. 
(I dont hold any responsibilty if u do something wrong or any other liability)
(Even tho any of the steps wont potensially harm your pc or any files.. but to be safe u can make a system restore point and restore back to your previous state of the machine if something goes wrong)

Easy RPC (by Pizzabelly) (https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP)

Pretty simple and easy to use... extract it and edit the config.ini file then simply run easyrp.exe

My Rich Presnece (by strukteon)(strukteon.net)

Needs java runtime to run :\
Go in the advcanced tab and dont forget to put your application id

Custom Discord RPC (i couldnt find the source code or the owner of that git... ill update this as soon as i find it)

It requires node.js and i wont say its complicated but ofc its a bit more work than the others.

Autobot (by Bloxigphy) (https://github.com/Bloxiphy/StreamingStatus.git)

using autobots is against TOS so i rather recommend u to not use this..
Even tho discord doesnt detect it but u may get banned if u get reported (bit risky) 

Make sure to read the readme.txt file in each of them just in case u are not able to navigate thru

Feel free to reach out to me aka Lakshya#1901 on discord for any help ^_^
